An app to make YouTube TV available to Windows.

YouTube used to have a cast to desktop feature, but it was removed some years ago. This app is a workaround to get YouTube TV on Windows. This way you're able to use your phone/tablet as a remote control, and queue videos.
This UWP application is a simple WebView2 frame that uses a custom User Agent String, emulating a Smart TV.
